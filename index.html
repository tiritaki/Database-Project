          You have been asked to develop a database for a local leisure centre,
          as they are in the process of upgrading their existing paper base
          record keeping system building for their swimming pool. They would
          like to use the database to help them manage their swimming lessons.
          Below are the entities and their attributes which were extracted from
          their paper-based system by a database developer who never got to
          implement the database for the local leisure centre. Use the entities
          and their attributes provided to create the respective tables. In
          addition, the leisure centre has now decided that they want two
          databases. A database implemented using SQL and a second NoSQL
          database, preferably using MySQL workbench and MongoDB respectively.
          It is the view that once the databases are successfully implemented,
          the leisure centre would then decide which of the databases they would
          possibly integrate with a front-end Python application.
